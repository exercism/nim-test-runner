## Todo list
1. [ ] Add tests (and fixing the bugs that finds) (*__In progress__*)
2. [ ] Strip filenames from JSON output (*__further clarification needed__*)
3. [ ] Capture output
   1. [ ] Limit output to 500 chars
4. [ ] Update the JSON output if the spec changes (adding the extra test and expected keys) (*__dependant on exercism/v3#1418__*)
